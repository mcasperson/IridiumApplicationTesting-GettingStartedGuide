# Launching
IAT can be run multiple different ways. Which method you choose depends on your use case.

## Java Web Start (JNLP)
 Web Start provides an easy way to launch IAT without requiring any special software beyond a standard Java 8 installation.
 
 IAT comes with a number of example test scripts which can be launched via Web Start. To run these examples, right click on the links below and save the jnlp files to the local disk. Then run the files with the `javaws` application.
